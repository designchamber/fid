            The Iris flower is  renowned for their striking, three-petaled flowers that often boast 
            vibrant colors and intricate patterns. These blooms feature three upright petals called 
            standards and three drooping petals known as falls. Their uses are diverse. Primarily, 
            irises are prized for their ornamental value, gracing gardens and floral arrangements with 
            their beauty. Certain species, particularly Iris germanica, yield orris root, a key ingredient 
            in perfumery used as a fixative and fragrance. The name "iris" comes from the Greek word for 
            "rainbow," reflecting the wide array of colors in which these flowers bloom.<br>
            Irises thrive in full sun, requiring at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight daily for optimal blooming. 
            They can tolerate partial shade, but full sun is ideal. Choose well-drained soil rich in organic matter.
            Remove spent flowers to encourage further blooming. Every 3 to 5 years, divide rhizomes to prevent 
            overcrowding and promote vigorous growth.

            The iris has been linked to wisdom, valor, and faith, making it a meaningful flower in various cultures. 
            Irises are often seen as symbols of hope and new beginnings.<br>
            Available Colors: Blue, purple, yellow, white, pink, brown, and orange.
