            Daisies, also known by their scientific name <em>"Bellis Perennis"</em> are delightful flowers that embody 
            simplicity and charm, making them a favorite in gardens and floral arrangements. Daisies typically feature 
            a bright yellow center surrounded by white or colored petals, resembling a cheerful sunburst.<br>
            Daisies thrive in full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of sunlight daily for optimal blooming. 
            They prefer average to sandy soil that is well-draining. A mix of sand, peat moss, and compost can enhance growth. 
            Regularly remove spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming.
