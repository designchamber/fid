            Roses belong to the genus <em>"Rosa"</em> and are celebrated for their beauty, fragrance, 
            and symbolism. With thousands of varieties, they come in a wide range of colors and 
            sizes, making them a favorite in gardens and floral arrangements. Their beauty makes 
            them a popular choice for special occasions like weddings and anniversaries.Roses have 
            been cultivated for thousands of years, and their historical significance spans various 
            cultures, often associated with mythology and art.<br>
            Roses thrive in full sun, requiring 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal 
            blooming. Choose a location with well-draining soil rich in organic matter to prevent root rot. 
            Regular pruning is essential for maintaining the shape and health of rose bushes. Prune in early 
            spring to remove dead or diseased wood and to encourage new growth.
