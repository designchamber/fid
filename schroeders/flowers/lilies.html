            These elegant flowers are celebrated for their striking beauty and captivating fragrance, 
            making them a popular choice in gardens and floral arrangements.Beyond their aesthetic 
            appeal, certain lily species possess medicinal properties; white lilies, for example, 
            are known for soothing pain, reducing swelling, and aiding water retention.<br>
            Lilies thrive in full sun, requiring 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal 
            blooming. Choose a location with well-draining soil rich in organic matter to prevent 
            bulb rot. After blooming, remove spent flowers to encourage further growth. In colder 
            climates, consider mulching to protect the bulbs during winter.
