            Tulips are vibrant, cup-shaped flowers belonging to the genus <em>"Tulipa"</em>. They 
            are one of the most popular spring-blooming perennials, known for their stunning 
            colors and elegant shapes. Originating from Central Asia, tulips have a rich 
            history and have become a symbol of spring in many cultures.Tulips are primarily 
            grown for their beautiful blooms and are widely used in gardens, parks, and as cut 
            flowers in floral arrangements. Tulips are one of the first flowers to bloom in spring, 
            often heralding the end of winter and the arrival of warmer weather!<br>
            Tulips thrive in full sun to light shade. Choose a location that receives at least 6 
            hours of sunlight daily.After blooming, allow the foliage to die back naturally. This 
            process helps the bulbs store energy for the next growing season. Avoid cutting the 
            leaves until they turn yellow.

            Tulips carry rich symbolism, often representing renewal, charity, and perfect love. Different 
            colors of tulips can convey various meanings; for example, red tulips symbolize true love, 
            while yellow tulips represent cheerful thoughts.<br>
            Available Colors: Red, yellow, pink, white, purple, orange, and burgundy.
